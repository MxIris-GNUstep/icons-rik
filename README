This set of icons, the app-wrappers are to be used in GNUstep with the rik.theme and Sombre.theme. 
See https://github.com/AlessandroSangiuliano/rik.theme.
    https://github.com/GNUstep/Sombre.theme.

The icons used in rik.theme are the 48x48 tiff files before this commit : https://github.com/BertrandDekoninck/RikIcons/commit/2c48eca659de81dbd31d6f94dbacba342144d0c5
The icons used in Sombre.theme are the 48x48 tiff files after that commit. I should have done another branch or repo, and I'm now confused to say I didn't.
The first part of this job was inspired by the Faenza icon theme and of course Macos.
The second part is inspired by the WhiteSur icon theme.

The SVG ones are the original files I made.
They are released under CreativeCommons (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ or 4.0).


I've created them using exclusively free software : Linux as OS, Inkscape for SVG, Gimp, Pikopixel and LaternaMagica for png/tiff creation, Firefox for web browsing, GNUstep/Gworkspace/Windowmaker for desktop.


Note that the app icons used in the app_wrappers are not my work. I've imported most appicons from the Whitesur icon theme from vinceliuice. See https://github.com/vinceliuice/WhiteSur-icon-theme.
